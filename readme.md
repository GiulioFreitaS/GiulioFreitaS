<h2>👋 Hi! I'm Giulio Pimentel</h2>

<p>
  I'm a technical high school student in
  <strong>Systems Development at ETEC Zona Leste (São Paulo, Brazil)</strong>,
  focused on building a strong foundation in programming and software development.
</p>

<p>
  In my first year of the course, I worked on an
  <strong>event organization and management website</strong>,
  developed as an academic project and
  <strong>presented to IBM</strong>.
  The project involved planning, development, and the final presentation of a
  functional solution.
</p>

<p>
  Currently, I am improving my skills in
  <strong>programming</strong>,
  <strong>web development</strong>, and
  <strong>software fundamentals</strong>,
  with a growing interest in
  <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  🎯 <strong>Goal:</strong> Gain practical experience, continuously improve my
  technical skills, and build a solid career in technology.
